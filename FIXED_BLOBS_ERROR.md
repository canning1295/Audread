# Netlify Blobs 502 Error - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
When trying to save settings, you were getting:
```
Error: Failed to save settings: 502 - MissingBlobsEnvironmentError
```

## Root Causes
1. **Netlify Blobs store** was being initialized at module level, before environment variables were available
2. **Edge function** (cors.ts) required Deno, which wasn't installed locally, causing deployment failures
3. **CORS headers** were missing from the serverless function responses

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Lazy Store Initialization âœ…
Changed the settings function to initialize the Blobs store **on-demand** (lazy initialization) instead of at module level:

```typescript
// Before: Store initialized at import time
const store = getStore({ name: 'audread-settings', consistency: 'strong' });

// After: Store initialized on first request
let store: ReturnType<typeof getStore>;
const initStore = () => {
  if (store) return store;
  store = getStore({ name: 'audread-settings', consistency: 'strong' });
  return store;
};
```

This ensures environment variables are available when the store is created.

### 2. Added CORS Headers to Settings Function âœ…
Since the edge function couldn't deploy, we added CORS headers directly to the settings serverless function:

```typescript
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET,POST,PUT,OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization'
};
```

All responses now include these headers.

### 3. Disabled Edge Function Temporarily âœ…
- Renamed `netlify/edge-functions/cors.ts` to `cors.ts.disabled`
- Commented out edge function configuration in `netlify.toml`
- CORS is now handled by the serverless functions directly

### 4. Linked Project to Netlify âœ…
Ran `netlify link` to connect the local project to your Netlify site, enabling:
- Access to environment variables
- Local development with `netlify dev`
- Easy deployments

### 5. Deployed Successfully âœ…
Deployed to production:
- **Production URL**: https://audreadible.netlify.app
- **Latest Deploy**: https://68e11bd91bac375155d8e955--audreadible.netlify.app

## Testing
Go to https://audreadible.netlify.app and try saving settings again. It should now work! ðŸŽ‰

## Environment Variables Confirmed
Your site has the following Netlify variables configured:
- âœ… `NETLIFY_BLOBS_CONTEXT`
- âœ… `AUTH0_DOMAIN`
- âœ… `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`
- âœ… `VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
- âœ… `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`
- âœ… `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN`

## Next Steps (Optional)

### To Re-enable Edge Functions (Future)
If you want to use Edge Functions for better CORS handling:

1. **Install Deno**:
   ```bash
   brew install deno
   ```

2. **Re-enable the edge function**:
   ```bash
   mv netlify/edge-functions/cors.ts.disabled netlify/edge-functions/cors.ts
   ```

3. **Uncomment in netlify.toml**:
   ```toml
   [[edge_functions]]
     function = "cors"
     path = "/api/*"
   ```

4. **Remove CORS from settings.ts** since it will be handled by the edge function

5. **Redeploy**:
   ```bash
   npx netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### For Local Development
Run the local Netlify dev server:
```bash
npm run netlify:dev
```
This will start the app with serverless functions at http://localhost:8888
