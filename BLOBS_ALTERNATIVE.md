# Netlify Blobs Issue - Alternative Solutions

## Current Problem
Netlify Blobs is not working despite:
- ✅ NETLIFY_BLOBS_CONTEXT environment variable is set
- ✅ Function code updated to use context
- ✅ Fresh deployments without cache

## Root Cause
The error "The environment has not been configured to use Netlify Blobs" suggests:
1. Netlify Blobs add-on may not be enabled on the site
2. Site may need to be on a specific plan
3. Missing system environment variables that Netlify should inject automatically

## Immediate Alternative: Use Netlify Key-Value Store (simpler)

Instead of Blobs, we can use a simpler approach:

### Option 1: Store Settings in User's JWT Claims (Auth0)
- Store settings in Auth0 user metadata
- Retrieve on login
- Update via Auth0 Management API
- ✅ No additional Netlify services needed
- ❌ Requires Auth0 Management API calls

### Option 2: Use Base64 + Netlify Functions with File Storage
- Store encrypted settings in a simple JSON file per user
- Use Netlify's deploy context to write to a data directory
- ❌ Files would be lost on each deploy

### Option 3: Use External Service
- Supabase (free tier)
- Firebase Firestore
- PlanetScale
- Upstash Redis
- ✅ Reliable and well-documented
- ❌ Additional service dependency

### Option 4: Check Netlify Blobs Status via Dashboard
Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/audreadible/configuration/addons
- Look for "Blobs" add-on
- Enable it if it's not enabled
- Check if your plan supports it

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check the Netlify Dashboard** for Blobs add-on status
2. If Blobs is not available, use **Upstash Redis** (free tier, very simple):
   ```bash
   npm install @upstash/redis
   ```
3. Or temporarily store in **Auth0 user metadata** until Blobs is working
